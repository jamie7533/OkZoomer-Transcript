00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Carole Namowicz: School isn't here yet.

2
00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:03.510
Carole Namowicz: But

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.770
Carole Namowicz: I see that she is

4
00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.899
Carole Namowicz: There in a

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.980
Carole Namowicz: In a separate Jude cat. She's probably joining us in just a second here again I accidentally joined the main zoom channel.

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.610
Carole Namowicz: That we have

7
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.960
Carole Namowicz: For this summer first and then realize, oh, when when our separate one today so

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
Carole Namowicz: We'll give her a minute or two to do that. But in the meantime, I'm hi

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.610
Carole Namowicz: I'm Carolyn mo. It's and

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.150
Carole Namowicz: This is obviously a chemistry unit.

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.220
Carole Namowicz: And

12
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.630
Carole Namowicz: If you don't mind.

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.500
Jamie Lee - Staff: If you guys

14
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.220
Carole Namowicz: Wouldn't mind introducing yourselves, or you can wait for Katie It's totally up to you.

15
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.080
Carole Namowicz: We can wait for Katie, that's cool.

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.670
Carole Namowicz: Um,

17
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.800
John Moore: I think I need to view your video before doing anything else.

18
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.030
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, please.

19
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.220
Carole Namowicz: If you haven't done that yet. By all means, take a couple minutes to go ahead and do that. Just to give you sort of the preview.

20
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
Carole Namowicz: So Joel Where are you are you from Northwestern or

21
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.220
So,

22
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.700
Joel Beier: Complicated my I am working with Sally's former advisor at the University of Wisconsin.

23
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.250
Joel Beier: However, my wife is a resident at Northwestern and campus down here in Chicago, so

24
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.150
Okay.

25
00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:00.510
Joel Beier: Yeah, lots of connections and in both locations. And so right. Right now we're in Chicago, since we're remote in Madison.

26
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.140
Carole Namowicz: Actually

27
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.580
Joel Beier: It's nice. Yeah.

28
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.110
Carole Namowicz: All right. And so, um, are you like researching right now then, or

29
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.970
Joel Beier: Yeah, so I am in my second year.

30
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.260
Joel Beier: Preparing to begin my second year at the University of Wisconsin.

31
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.860
Joel Beier: Okay. For that, I was a high school chemistry teacher for five years.

32
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.150
Joel Beier: Gotcha started down in Phoenix, and then spent four years in northeast Indiana and now we're here.

33
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.650
Carole Namowicz: Okay, very good.

34
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.540
Joel Beier: Yeah, actually I recognize they like the soda can, because that's one that I did.

35
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.970
Carole Namowicz: Oh yeah, we've actually been doing

36
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.490
Carole Namowicz: This year is going to be a little different.

37
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.060
Carole Namowicz: Obviously, um, and in fact CPS came out with this goofy crazy hybrid plan.

38
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.590
Carole Namowicz: What, to be frank, what we as teachers are all planning this year is we're planning remotes because even if we're forced to be in a classroom.

39
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:05.250
Carole Namowicz: It's going to be six feet apart masks on you on your computer me on mine. I'm not handing you papers, we're not using any materials. Everything is going to be a video like

40
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.320
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, it is what it is.

41
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.010
Joel Beier: So when I first saw before getting into

42
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.360
Carole Namowicz: The road. That's all right. I mean, we're waiting for WAITING FOR JOHN to come back and go

43
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:28.650
Joel Beier: Well, when I first saw the plan. I, I felt bad for everybody who is working because you're gonna have to come up with a plan for the kids who are online and a plan for the kids are in person.

44
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.340
Carole Namowicz: Yes. Um, so, again, I think that

45
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.010
Carole Namowicz: In mind. Most of us are just going with

46
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.900
Carole Namowicz: Everything's online.

47
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.850
Joel Beier: That's fair.

48
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:51.270
Carole Namowicz: Well, it's fair. And it's also like, I don't want to be taking home giant stacks of papers into my own home and like you know the the transfer of simple materials from home to school and back again.

49
00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:01.650
Carole Namowicz: Not, not a good idea. And so, yeah. Um, but yeah. So essentially the cam crush thing.

50
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.340
Carole Namowicz: We've been doing it for a number of years as a major lab.

51
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.320
Carole Namowicz: Oh, yeah. Oh, what, what we've done is over the past, I want to say at least the last four or five years.

52
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:26.220
Carole Namowicz: We've been doing it as a lab where we introduce it and then students go through and decide variables that they're going to possibly change and we spend a good two weeks.

53
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:41.250
Carole Namowicz: Allowing them to really take lots and lots and lots of trials. Um, so that they can get a really good set of data and they can they can recognize outliers and we go through uncertainty and all that kind of thing. Um,

54
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:53.220
Carole Namowicz: And so there's that aspect, but then there's also the aspect of obviously then we have them you know formatting presenting their data in graphical form.

55
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.220
Carole Namowicz: Where they're going to look to determine the

56
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.950
Carole Namowicz: The independent variable we wind up, allowing them to either choose a different can size we collect cans.

57
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.880
Carole Namowicz: All your low yeah possible. Um, but they choose different can size or different month time in a hot plate different model water in the thing are different.

58
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.340
Carole Namowicz: Like temp of the bucket. And then the dependent variable is the percent crush.

59
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:28.560
Carole Namowicz: So they spend all this time collecting this data and you know after they get the hang of crushing it. Then they can start to see when they do have outliers. When because since they're doing multiple trials for a set data point, um,

60
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.850
Carole Namowicz: And something this year was and it looks like John's popping back so so we can talk about this, um,

61
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.850
Carole Namowicz: Oh wait, won't see him. Hi john

62
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.540
Hi.

63
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.830
Carole Namowicz: I'm so I'm Carol again. And did you get, you got a chance to see the video we were actually just talking about the Candy Crush thing.

64
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.700
Right.

65
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.830
Carole Namowicz: Um, and if you don't mind me stopping and asking, Are you from Northwestern or what's your affiliation here.

66
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.410
John Moore: No, I mean your University of Wisconsin Madison.

67
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.420
Carole Namowicz: Okay.

68
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.980
John Moore: So Sally. Sally did some things up here before then, and northwestern so

69
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.100
Carole Namowicz: Very good. Um, so, essentially, I was just explaining to Joel that we have

70
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:22.020
Carole Namowicz: The can crush is a big, it's our big first lab. So essentially gas laws is our big first unit of the year.

71
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:31.920
Carole Namowicz: We use it as a jumping off point for students to start to see micro to macro. That's a big connection. We're always making throughout the year and chemistry.

72
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:43.920
Carole Namowicz: Is what's happening on microscopic scale that is causing our observations on the macroscopic scale. So we want them to see that connection right away so that throughout the year, we can keep making that jump back and forth.

73
00:06:44.430 --> 00:07:00.480
Carole Namowicz: Um, so obviously these these simulations help a great deal with that we do something on the macroscopic scale to start off with like the Candy Crush and we immediately then go to okay what's happening on the microscopic scale that made that happen.

74
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.940
Carole Namowicz: So that's really where these

75
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:15.090
Carole Namowicz: Were the simulations individually, and then the can cross simulation. What I was explaining Joel is this is usually major lab that we do and we're not gonna be able to do it this year at least

76
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:27.750
Carole Namowicz: Not in person, not as intended. So what we met and then Jamie's been working on is creating this simulation of the can crush that then has old zoom in on

77
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:38.070
Carole Namowicz: And it's just in the it's in the very early stages. Right now, we walked through it yesterday and talk through all the changes that need to be made, but really it's um

78
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.500
Carole Namowicz: We're going to use that so that students still can collect can still collect data.

79
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:54.750
Carole Namowicz: Can still, you know, organize the data graph the data, all the things that we would want them to do with the real experiments, but this year. They're going to have to use the simulation in order to do that.

80
00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:03.300
Carole Namowicz: Um, but another reason we thought this simulation would be really helpful is when students do do this lab is the real thing.

81
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:15.840
Carole Namowicz: They get really confused about what actually is happening on a microscopic scale in order to explain it. We get lots of pirated answers from the internet because it's all over the internet these days as far as what's happening with the can and all that, but

82
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:26.010
Carole Namowicz: Do they actually understand it. Um, so we think that even hopefully after everything's okay and who's vaccinated and we go back

83
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:32.250
Carole Namowicz: Um, that the simulation will be really helpful for students that did the actual experiment real life.

84
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:40.890
Carole Namowicz: To compare and contrast it with the simulation to see if their data is good or not, like, if their data is actually what should have happened.

85
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:53.940
Carole Namowicz: And there'll be able to look at the little zoom in feature to see what the particles are doing at that moment, to see if they really do understand what happened or not. So that's really a big A big piece of our units, um,

86
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.470
Carole Namowicz: So I'm going to stop talking and let you guys ask some questions since you've seen the videos and such.

87
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:05.670
John Moore: I had one question you had them working on a simulation and that they were building their own simulation. The students as ever.

88
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:12.990
John Moore: Yes. So are they going to simulate what happens in the can crush or

89
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:28.170
Carole Namowicz: Not yet, it's a it's a more simplified, it's a more simplified model than that. So the, the overall gist of our unit is we show them the can crush it just to get them thinking about it. It's our phenomenon. Then from there, we start with

90
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:38.250
Carole Namowicz: I'm simply temperature. So then we're going to do like a food coloring and hot water cold water things so that they can see particles move faster hot slow trickle. Great.

91
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:45.090
Carole Namowicz: From there we go to volume and temperature. And then we introduce pressure and then through all these stages.

92
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.550
Carole Namowicz: They'll begin to see the different gas variables to pressure volume temperature number of particles.

93
00:09:51.090 --> 00:10:00.060
Carole Namowicz: And they'll also be able to see the relationships between all of those variables when you hold the others constant. So we're going to take all those relationships.

94
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.500
Carole Namowicz: And throughout this they'll be seeing what the gas particles are supposed to be looking like right

95
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.920
Carole Namowicz: After they have all that under their belts, we move on to the simulation that you're referring to, which is this net tango.

96
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:24.750
Carole Namowicz: Where the students are using blocks of code to build the gas movement. So it's not yet meant to be the can crush. It's simply getting them to come up with a postulates of kinetic molecular theory on their own.

97
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:32.610
Carole Namowicz: So we want them based on what they've seen in a simulation gas particles are doing to step back, think about

98
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:47.940
Carole Namowicz: Those simulations as a computer programmer and give us the rules for particle movement like what are the rules. If you were a computer programmer. What did you tell those particles to do on the screen to make them do that and really just

99
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:56.790
Carole Namowicz: tearing it down, who most basic level, because what we find is students, students will skip over the obvious they never say

100
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:06.840
Carole Namowicz: Particles must move them straight lines like it's pulling teeth to get them to come up with that because they've already run past that. So we have to stop them.

101
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.740
Carole Namowicz: And be like, hold on. And usually what I do in the classroom, which is

102
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.950
Carole Namowicz: You know it's going to be a little bit of a challenge this year, but typically what I do in the classroom is when they skip that part.

103
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:32.310
Carole Namowicz: I do the I'm the gas particle and I start running around in circles and bumping into tables and saying, Tell me how to move, tell me how to move. I'm a gas particle on the gas particle, until finally, a student will go, you have to walk in a straight line. Okay, there you go.

104
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.730
John Moore: There, we don't have any drunk good gas.

105
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.180
Particle

106
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.740
Carole Namowicz: Right, but they don't they don't think about

107
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.270
Carole Namowicz: Like, oh, that's how gas particle moves. It's like so.

108
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.110
John Moore: I'm trying to understand a little more about the

109
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.980
Carole Namowicz: Simulation

110
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.290
John Moore: You said there are these blocks of code that

111
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:58.170
John Moore: Like the one block is sort of saying the particle is to move in a straight line or

112
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:06.450
Carole Namowicz: Yes, in fact, hold on. I'm gonna pull it up. I can pull up the simulation. Give me one moment, then I can share the screen with you to show you what this looks like.

113
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.690
Carole Namowicz: It's got to get to the right lesson here.

114
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.010
One more. Here we go.

115
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.690
Carole Namowicz: You and

116
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.150
Carole Namowicz: Alright share screen.

117
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.050
Carole Namowicz: All right. Can we see this

118
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:41.760
Carole Namowicz: Yes. Okay, great. Alright, so this is the net logo, the net logo and essentially, it starts off the blocks of code are as you see down here at the bottom.

119
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:54.030
Carole Namowicz: Where it says at go each particle moves. And then there's a little drop down menu and then it says if it touches the wall and then there's gonna be another little drop down menu. So if I press set up right now and go what you see right now is

120
00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:10.350
Carole Namowicz: The particles are moving a radically and if they touch a wall, they will bounce back like a basketball. Now notice we're missing some code here. And if you watch the two particles go close to each other. You see that, what did they do.

121
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:21.450
Carole Namowicz: They actually are going across each other. Do you notice that that's because in the code. We don't yet have how the particles should interact when they

122
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:35.370
Carole Namowicz: collide with each other yet. So right now what we're expecting students to do and working with this is, again, they've seen simulations where they've seen how the particles are supposed to be moving. So how are they going to make this code look like that.

123
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:43.260
Carole Namowicz: So one of the first things they have to do erratic should be straight. As soon as they change something down here in the bottom. They need to re compile

124
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.970
Carole Namowicz: So now we're compiling. Now you see that the particles are moving in straight lines. That one's not moving at the moment, um,

125
00:13:51.690 --> 00:14:08.070
Carole Namowicz: But we also don't have coded. What's going to happen when each particle touches another particle. So if something touches and other particle, what should it do so we're expecting them to go through this process of and I'm going to re compile again.

126
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.330
Carole Namowicz: We're expecting them to go through this process.

127
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.000
Carole Namowicz: Sorry, I should have said set up and go again. There we go. So right now we have

128
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:25.350
Carole Namowicz: Code for what happens when they hit the wall. What happens when they hit each other, but we have this thing where it says bounces like a basketball.

129
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.090
Carole Namowicz: And what you'll notice over time is this setting is actually meant

130
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:40.290
Carole Namowicz: For the balls themselves to sort of lose kinetic energy or overall energy over time, which is not what gas particles in a closed container should be doing.

131
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:52.680
Carole Namowicz: So one of the final changes we're expecting them to make is to then go ahead and go through here and shoes. OKAY. HOW IS, HOW ARE THE BALLS hitting each other and like a bill a billiard ball.

132
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.490
Carole Namowicz: Will cause them to

133
00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.050
Whoops.

134
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:10.500
Carole Namowicz: Really move as they should. And we're going to need to change both of these to say as a billiard ball and as soon as students figure that one out. Um, then the particles should be moving

135
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:23.550
Carole Namowicz: Like they should. And it's really, it's the billiard ball is meant to represent elastic collisions. Um, so that's what we're seeing. Finally, because students are able to articulate that

136
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:32.820
Carole Namowicz: When they look through when they see a simulation and they see two particles hitting each other we do go through the process of discussing okay if we have this one.

137
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.650
Carole Namowicz: I'm moving and this one's moving a certain speed that's max into each other. Do they both

138
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:45.270
Carole Namowicz: You know, when they bounce off to they both wind up going at identical speeds or the speed, they're traveling at before and the students do realize

139
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:56.220
Carole Namowicz: No, not necessarily. But overall, the energy is completely transferred and the energy is conserved. So we go through that concept.

140
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.280
Carole Namowicz: With this idea of the billiard ball.

141
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:07.530
Carole Namowicz: And all those students don't play billiards they all do have like little pool. You know, there's pool on their phone, you know, I'm talking about like they think they do that a lot. So

142
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:14.670
Carole Namowicz: As soon as you say when they asked billiard ball and you go, you know, like pool on your phone and then they'll go oh yeah so they know what that is.

143
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:23.370
Carole Namowicz: Um, and that makes sense to them because they've played that and and so they can apply that here and make sense of it to get to here.

144
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:31.770
Carole Namowicz: I'm obviously I ran through it quickly, students will take a considerably longer time to get there. And we also want them to really help each other.

145
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:44.130
Carole Namowicz: With the code again virtually or remote or whatever is going to happen this year we're still trying to figure out how this is going to work. Um, because obviously a lot of group work is going to be lost. I'm is okay if I

146
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.560
Carole Namowicz: Had done

147
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.700
John Moore: Completely out of it, but I have no idea what pool on the phone looks like.

148
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:51.360
Carole Namowicz: Oh, no.

149
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.460
Carole Namowicz: It's really in their phone with the

150
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.900
John Moore: Balls never stop and pull on the phone.

151
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:14.430
Carole Namowicz: They don't stay really. I mean, they know they do, they do stop but it's meant to be like the phone itself is usually just like the flat billiards table. So the whole thing is green. And then they just move their finger around to like shoot the cue ball at something

152
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:20.760
John Moore: Yeah, so I'm still I'm a little concerned about the analogy because the billiard balls, all these energy to

153
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.450
Carole Namowicz: Do

154
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.230
Carole Namowicz: They do.

155
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.530
John Moore: They have the same potential energy gravitational anyway kinetic energy goes away. So

156
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:38.100
Carole Namowicz: Not going to argue that point at all. Essentially, this the the notion of saying how it moves and comparing it to a ball.

157
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:46.440
Carole Namowicz: And this is something that the CT stem group was discussing many years ago. I've been. I've been working with them. Now, for this is my fourth summer.

158
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:55.350
Carole Namowicz: And not last summer, but the summer before that we were sitting in a room and they really we really just started to use this

159
00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:03.480
Carole Namowicz: They were starting to develop net tango. And we talked about. Wouldn't it be great have something like this for looking at K empty.

160
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:16.920
Carole Namowicz: And energy and how energy is transferred and one of the issues is if you make the wording with the ball bouncing back to I don't want to say to science. See, but we had to make

161
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.730
Carole Namowicz: It approachable somehow for students to be able to feel like they knew what these little drop downs meant

162
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:34.680
Carole Namowicz: Um, so yes billiard balls, obviously, do you know some some energy would wind up being gone because the friction. I mean,

163
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:43.680
Carole Namowicz: You know, not gone but friction would be at play here as would gravity. And so, things of that nature would have an effect and they don't in the simulation.

164
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:52.200
Carole Namowicz: So that's not a perfect thing, but it's the best analogy, when we were talking about balls for what that would look like.

165
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:58.440
Carole Namowicz: Um, so their, their choices here are simply football, basketball billiard ball. There's another version.

166
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:10.980
Carole Namowicz: On the CT stem site where there's a balloon, but we actually thought balloon and basketball were very similar. So we removed balloon from our version of that to try and get kids as close to this idea as possible.

167
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:21.570
John Moore: Did you follow up on that. Then, as to the differences between the the simulation and

168
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:28.980
Carole Namowicz: Absolutely. And in fact, I'm. This is one I think we have this question here on the next page yet.

169
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:42.150
Carole Namowicz: Think we just asked them about the blocks here. And in fact, I don't think we have it in this particular lesson. But this is one of those questions that we're always asking students when they're working with a simulation.

170
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:54.990
Carole Namowicz: We will ask them to compare and contrast it to the real world. What are the advantages. What are the advantages of the simulation over the real world. What are the advantages of the real world over the simulation.

171
00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:08.160
Carole Namowicz: What things that exist in the real world. We're not present in the simulation because they never completely you know they're not the same. And that's intentional because we want the simulation to show things

172
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:23.970
Carole Namowicz: That obviously we can't see, but it also is not going to act exactly as the real world would act we've we've removed certain things for our own interests to try and get at the you know the end goal for whatever particular lesson that we're in.

173
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:30.000
John Moore: Right, okay. And the, the simulation tool that you're using.

174
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.650
John Moore: Where did that come from.

175
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.830
Carole Namowicz: This, this particular on net tango.

176
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:49.650
Carole Namowicz: Yes, this was developed by the CT stem group. And I want to say about two or three years ago. So net logo in and of itself was was written by Yuri wilensky I don't know however many years ago.

177
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.490
John Moore: I guess my

178
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.000
John Moore: My curiosity was about whether it's available to other people or

179
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.470
Carole Namowicz: Oh yes, absolutely.

180
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.200
Carole Namowicz: Yes, it is. Um, and, in fact, it's

181
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:10.380
Carole Namowicz: Not only is it available to other people. But there's there's more versions of this than just fix this key empty version. So there is a published, there's

182
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:20.010
Carole Namowicz: Within the the connected chemistry on the CT style site and hold on, I can go there. Um, so

183
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.860
John Moore: You don't have to show me. I just, I was just curious as to

184
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:24.540
Carole Namowicz: Right here, so

185
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.390
John Moore: I'm sort of monopolizing the conversation.

186
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.720
John Moore: I know if Joe wants to get a word in edgewise.

187
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.190
Carole Namowicz: By all means.

188
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.920
Joel Beier: I'm enjoying listening to both of you described.

189
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:45.210
Joel Beier: Each of these, but I guess one of my questions that I had was, in what ways do you plan on using

190
00:21:45.840 --> 00:22:05.310
Joel Beier: These simulations in the classrooms. When I first saw the structure of the prior page I thought of it as a great for lack of a better term, I'll say conversation piece a way to start the class and then dig into to John's point some of the deeper

191
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:15.750
Joel Beier: Concepts and was and I guess I was just curious if you've put any thought into the ways that you plan on integrating this into the classroom.

192
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:24.450
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, absolutely. Um, so that net logo in particular is actually we don't do that as the start of class, um, it's

193
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:34.140
Carole Namowicz: For it. This is a sophomore level class and for many students this type of a thing just to be shown the code and told go would be really overwhelming.

194
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:43.170
Carole Namowicz: Be spend for that particular lesson, we will spend a little bit of time just looking at, we actually have the fence simulation.

195
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:50.790
Carole Namowicz: A gas. The gas properties one we show them that one initially just so they see the particles bouncing around.

196
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:59.430
Carole Namowicz: We asked them to watch the particles that are bouncing around and then not on computer but usually we would do this like on you know some

197
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:10.110
Carole Namowicz: Large posts or something. Obviously. Again, not this year but um we have them come up with just on paper. What are the rules for political movement.

198
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.870
Carole Namowicz: Write out all your rules for political movement. And so we have them do that on paper first

199
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:25.830
Carole Namowicz: And then they'll think through it with their table groups and you know make comments on each other's really to sort of see what everybody else is thinking

200
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.960
Carole Namowicz: And then we throw them into the net tango, where they have to do the programming aspects. So

201
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:39.120
Carole Namowicz: By the time they get to the programming aspect, they should already have a really good sense of what they're expecting the particles to look like when they're moving around.

202
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:48.900
Carole Namowicz: So, so that way, it's not so overwhelming. We want them to already have that clear sense of I want the particles to do this. I want the particles. To do this, I want to do this.

203
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:58.560
Carole Namowicz: So that the the the coating seems more approachable. And that's, again, obviously also the reason for the blocks, rather than just sending them into the logo language, um,

204
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:08.340
Carole Namowicz: So we do that other simulations. There's always an end goal, where they will be, you know, taking data, um,

205
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:15.570
Carole Namowicz: One of the first lessons we have I mentioned that we start off with the can crush and then we move from there and just the

206
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:28.260
Carole Namowicz: food coloring things so they can see the temperature relationship. And then after that, we'll move into volume and temperature. Okay. So how does temperature effect volume. Here's another place will, we will be using a simple simulation.

207
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:36.660
Carole Namowicz: So that students can see the direct effect that temperature will have on volume holding other variables constant

208
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:45.120
Carole Namowicz: And we'll ask them to acquire data from a simulation and it will be numerical data and then they'll be asked to grab that data and we're going to be utilizing Kodak

209
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:56.730
Carole Namowicz: Um, within that lesson so that the graph will essentially a pure for them. Um, we would typically this year. Again, I keep saying this year. This year, this year, but

210
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:06.960
Carole Namowicz: We've had to change a lot of things we're taking out some inquiry. We're being more direct with certain things where we wouldn't be as direct

211
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.170
Carole Namowicz: We're also being a little bit more hand holding with

212
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:19.170
Carole Namowicz: Graphical type things because we want to make sure that all the students on their screen are actually going to have a direct relationship of temperature versus volume on their screen when they're done.

213
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:27.960
Carole Namowicz: So the code app interface is going to be integrated with the net logo simulation that woman is adjusting for us.

214
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:36.540
Carole Namowicz: And the graph itself when they're collecting the data. It's just going to up here, we're not really having them make it. It's just kind of going to appear for them at this point.

215
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:44.940
Carole Namowicz: But because this is the first unit of the year. We need to get out the idea of what does a direct relationship look like graphically.

216
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:55.920
Carole Namowicz: What does an indirect relationships look like graphically so that they have those pieces to take with them throughout the entire year and chemistry because we'll keep coming back to that when we're looking at data.

217
00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:04.380
Carole Namowicz: Will ask them, What's the relationship here all the time. And we'll refer back to, you know, the last unit data sets as examples of those things.

218
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.060
John Moore: So I had another question about the can crush itself.

219
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.300
John Moore: Is there any do explore any variables related so they can crush.

220
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.920
John Moore: Unless you had ice water.

221
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.000
John Moore: But I mean, you could probably even do that.

222
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.370
John Moore: With videos this year, again, getting back to this year.

223
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.210
John Moore: I wonder what you actually did when when you were doing it typically

224
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.490
Carole Namowicz: Typically, first I want to preface this by saying we've taken out layers of

225
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:46.170
Carole Namowicz: We've taken up from higher order thinking this year. Usually this entire unit is based around a gas tanker imploding.

226
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:55.740
Carole Namowicz: So it's like a train gas tanker imploding. And then the can is like a parallel to it because they're basically doing the same thing and we walked through that.

227
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:07.320
Carole Namowicz: We took out that extra layer. This year, because again, having kids have to make those parallels when we're not going to be in class to walk them through it and do everything together.

228
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.640
Carole Namowicz: We just took it out. So we went straight up with can crush, but

229
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:22.740
Carole Namowicz: They will be manipulating it um what they usually do every year. Is this is our big lab and we take like a good two weeks, and I'm going to stop sharing the screen if that's okay with you guys so I can see everybody better um

230
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:36.810
Carole Namowicz: What we usually do is this is our big lab, we will demo it for them and then ask them to come up with. Well, what are the different variables that we could manipulate here. We let them come up with a million on, you know, we'll write them all on the board and they come up with a good

231
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:44.760
Carole Namowicz: Crazy variables we could fill it with maple syrup. Okay, fine. Um, but then we narrow it down to

232
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:55.440
Carole Namowicz: We can change the size of the can. Because, do we have different size cans. Yes, we do. I mentioned to Joel earlier that we literally save cans for an entire year, every year, so that we have cans for this lab.

233
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:02.580
Carole Namowicz: So we have the big Tall Boys regular sized cans and then the little mini eight ounce ones we have all those readily available.

234
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.840
Carole Namowicz: We also will allow them to change the amount of water. They put inside the can.

235
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.760
Carole Namowicz: We will allow them to change the amount of time they leave the can, on the hot plate.

236
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:26.370
Carole Namowicz: And finally we will allow them to change the temperature of the ice bucket. So it can be, you know, hot water ice water room temperature water. We're limited with exact temperatures, um, because although we have obviously we have thermometers and temperature sensors.

237
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:34.470
Carole Namowicz: maintaining an exact temperature, not going to happen. But at least we can say, you know, hot room temperature cold and then they can give us the temperature seized

238
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:46.560
Carole Namowicz: So they will choose one of these variables as a table group and then manipulate it everybody's dependent variable is identical everyone's dependent variable is going to be percent crush.

239
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.070
Carole Namowicz: And we show them what that means, because essentially we have them.

240
00:28:50.460 --> 00:29:00.000
Carole Namowicz: We have them fill the can determine the volume to start with. They poured into a you know a gigantic graduated cylinder to find the starting volume. And then after the crush the can then they find the final volume.

241
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:09.000
Carole Namowicz: And then they do a subtraction and division and we give them a formula for that so they don't get confused, but they ultimately determine percent crush for each variable.

242
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.430
Carole Namowicz: They should be finding that the size of the can really doesn't make any difference.

243
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.650
Carole Namowicz: Because if you're doing a percentage of a crush, not just how much it crushed it really doesn't make any difference.

244
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:31.410
Carole Namowicz: The amount of time on a hot plate should make a difference. The amount of water in the can should make a difference. And then finally, the amount of the temperature of the bucket also should make a difference. Um,

245
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:40.800
Carole Namowicz: We have them do an ideal crush, if you will, we give them the parameters for that. There's exactly 10 mils of water that goes in the can.

246
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:50.160
Carole Namowicz: And they put it on the hot plate and as soon as the steam comes out, we tell them to count to 20 seconds and they will also have a stopwatch there so that they know exactly how long it's been sitting on the can.

247
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:56.970
Carole Namowicz: And then we tell them to use that magic number, whatever it was, for their hot plate as their control. Um, from then on.

248
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.060
Carole Namowicz: They will also

249
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:09.060
Carole Namowicz: Then they also have to use the standard size, can they will also have to use the standard size can for this particular

250
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:24.360
Carole Namowicz: For this trial sort of set all their parameters as their controls and then we spend a good like two weeks, letting them take trial trial upon trial on trial because we use this lab as

251
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:32.400
Carole Namowicz: A means of looking at uncertainty and looking at outliers and their data. And when they understand what an outlier is we say okay

252
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:39.990
Carole Namowicz: Take another take another trial. And again, it's, it's a lot of cans, so we make sure that we have enough cans to do this.

253
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:51.810
Carole Namowicz: But because we couldn't do this this year. That's where we met Jamie myself and Katie came up with the idea of, let's do a simulation for this this year so they can still do the lab.

254
00:30:53.070 --> 00:31:03.030
Carole Namowicz: And they'll still be able to take data, we intend to add percent crush numbers with it, depending upon the parameters that they set and we have enough

255
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:10.260
Carole Namowicz: Old lab reports that we can pull data so that we can set that we can set the simulation with those numbers, um,

256
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:24.300
Carole Namowicz: But we also see this as being really great tool. After covert we're hoping that students will be able to see what's happening within their cans throughout the experiments.

257
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:35.910
Carole Namowicz: You know, when they couldn't zoom in and see it in the simulation. Now, there'll be able to, so it'll be an after they do their experiment type thing. Then we'll give them the simulation and say, okay, go check your data.

258
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:45.540
Carole Namowicz: First, see if your data matches up with the simulation we have here. So, you know, if it's good or not, but also if you were confused about what was happening on a microscopic level.

259
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:53.790
Carole Namowicz: This simulation will help you. You're going to see what's happening in the can to begin with what's happening in the can is it heats up.

260
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:59.580
Carole Namowicz: What's happening in the can. After we flip it over into the ice bucket. So there'll be able to see that.

261
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:12.780
Carole Namowicz: And I think that, that'll really help their understanding because they'll be able to connect it piece by piece to see why the can crushes on so that's why we're really hoping that this simulation is not just useful for this year but well beyond this year.

262
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.810
John Moore: Okay, great. Thank you.

263
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.730
John Moore: No problem. Um,

264
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:22.230
John Moore: My directions from Sally were to send spend 25 minutes

265
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.600
John Moore: First to go somewhere else. Now,

266
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.540
Jamie Lee - Staff: Guys are free to look

267
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.120
Jamie Lee - Staff: Around rooms. Yeah.

268
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.700
John Moore: Okay, fine. I read the directions and

269
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.220
John Moore: So,

270
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.550
John Moore: There were supposed to go to another one of these are not

271
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.520
Carole Namowicz: No, please, by all means, jump to another one.

272
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.910
Jamie Lee - Staff: Okay. All the links are in the pilot for the other so

273
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.870
John Moore: I will go back and do that. Thanks for sending the URL you kidding me.

274
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.420
Jamie Lee - Staff: Yeah, no problem for the tango. Yeah.

275
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.820
John Moore: I mean, leave this meeting and try another one. This is really interesting.

276
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.020
Joel Beier: And I did not have instructions to leave so

277
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.260
Carole Namowicz: I

278
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.570
Joel Beier: Have a no. But I do have a question.

279
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:22.740
Joel Beier: Leading back to your experiment with the kiddos. And it sounds like they're all doing or all the groups are doing different experiments. How do you typically have them report their results.

280
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.990
Carole Namowicz: Um, so they are required to it's a lab report.

281
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:37.290
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, it's a huge lab report in terms of reporting their results they need to show us a minimum of nine trials in a data table.

282
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:45.150
Carole Namowicz: Because that we have them take at least three trials per so if you're changing the size of the can, small, medium, large, right, they have to do three trials each

283
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:57.480
Carole Namowicz: We tell them specifically to be looking out for outliers. So if you need to do more than nine trials, you're going to need to do an extra one, you know. So if you get a really goofy one. Do it again. And we get them used to that like

284
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:04.980
Carole Namowicz: It's science. Um, so then they take an average percent crush and we asked them, um,

285
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.860
Carole Namowicz: We asked them to

286
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:11.400
Carole Namowicz: Go to

287
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:31.350
Carole Namowicz: We ask them to then graph the data. So they graph the data where they have their independent variable, whatever it was on the X axis, obviously, and then percent crush shown on there why I'm and we make sure that they're independent variable is numerical

288
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:46.110
Carole Namowicz: Some kids will be like small, medium, large can. I'm like, guys, you took the volumes of those, like, give me the actual numbers. It's not small, medium and large. Same thing with like the temperatures, they'll say, you know, cold and room temperature and hot, they

289
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:52.080
Carole Namowicz: Put the numbers on there. Um, so this is our first chance to really stress this

290
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.770
Yeah.

291
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.140
Carole Namowicz: And what

292
00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.540
Joel Beier: What do you have them share with each other through presentations or

293
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.800
Carole Namowicz: So what they do.

294
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:14.400
Carole Namowicz: For all lab reports we have a group of kids usually for kids will be doing the same lab and they will be sharing their data sharing their graphs with each other.

295
00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:18.060
Carole Namowicz: So we expect from a lab table to get the same data tables.

296
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:24.300
Carole Namowicz: Graphs, but then we have them write a lab report and ultimately in a claim evidence reasoning format.

297
00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:34.260
Carole Namowicz: Have to make a claim about whether, you know, did your independent variable dependent variable either have a you know a direct relationship, an inverse relationship in direct

298
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:43.320
Carole Namowicz: Or no relationship at all, which is really hard for kids to say no relationship we go heavy on that. And like look at a lot of graphs with no relationship.

299
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:51.000
Carole Namowicz: Before their lab report is due to get them comfortable saying that because some of them are just like, that's just mind blowing to say it didn't do anything.

300
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:58.560
Carole Namowicz: But they do that. And then they have to after they make that claim they have to support that using evidence and then they talk about

301
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:06.360
Carole Namowicz: Within the reasoning, they have to talk about what the particles were doing throughout and why and why this cause this we have, you know, a very detailed rubric, um,

302
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:16.380
Carole Namowicz: But what we do with that is students in the same group have to have a different evidence in a different reasoning we use turn it in calm. Where's to

303
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:25.260
Carole Namowicz: Mid all their lab reports, because that's where we get, like, no, like you guys did the lab together, but you didn't sit down and write the whole thing together so

304
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.320
Joel Beier: The exact same thing for beetham before. Yeah.

305
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.430
Carole Namowicz: Yes, and I mean we still get kids where it's like, literally, you know, word

306
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:40.290
Carole Namowicz: For word and the word for word. And then, you know, every two sentences. They changed the word using the thesaurus, and it's it's

307
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:48.630
Carole Namowicz: Yeah. Um, but it's the first lab report of the year. So if they're going to make that silly mistake. Now's the time so we can catch them so they don't do it again.

308
00:36:49.080 --> 00:37:00.660
Carole Namowicz: I'm sure we can learn. Well, exactly. So we can learn will still get an F on this, but they they still have a chance to significantly reduce standards based grading. So even if they can

309
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:06.090
Carole Namowicz: Do this lab because they plagiarize or something. There's another lab anyway.

310
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.290
Carole Namowicz: So they'd be fine.

311
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.370
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, I'm as long as they learned their lesson and did what they were supposed to do.

312
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.790
Carole Namowicz: Um, so, um,

313
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:25.980
Carole Namowicz: They we don't have them present to each other. Um, it's a lab report, but we do allow like because it's their first lab report, we give them in class working time.

314
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:38.160
Carole Namowicz: Okay, not only like for us to be able to help make sure that they're doing their graphs correctly and ask lots of questions and stuff like that. Um, but when they're setting up their labs to that's when, as a teacher, I'm walking around.

315
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.820
Carole Namowicz: And making

316
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:50.280
Carole Namowicz: For like okay you know first tell me what your control settings were in terms of exactly how long did you leave it on the hot plate. What you manipulate. Because to get them to see that.

317
00:37:51.450 --> 00:38:06.000
Carole Namowicz: They really have to be careful with their controls and you know if you left it on a hot plate for for one minute and 49 seconds and you're changing the temperature of the ice bucket you better leave it on the hot plate for one minute and 49 seconds. Every single stink and trial and

318
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.540
Carole Namowicz: They get that. But it takes some time.

319
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.950
Carole Namowicz: Very often kids have run through at least two or three trials before I get to them and go

320
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.760
Joel Beier: Whoa.

321
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.980
Carole Namowicz: I need to redo those and we we budget that time in there so that they

322
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.000
Carole Namowicz: Do them.

323
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:26.580
Carole Namowicz: So, you know, again, it's like we spend literally two weeks on this and we have

324
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.450
Carole Namowicz: We run in 100 minute blocks, two times

325
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:46.170
Carole Namowicz: So literally, like 400 minutes of working time where that is going from the demo of it to the students figuring out what their independent variable is going to be to actually just practicing the crusher can which takes a good half an hour in and of itself.

326
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:56.430
Carole Namowicz: To actually running all the trials, then doing new trials for any outliers. If they find them and then to actually sit down and start making graphs like we try to budget in that

327
00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:04.470
Carole Namowicz: lab report working time so that any groups that really didn't screw up and need to do a bunch of extra trials can so you know flexibility.

328
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.750
Joel Beier: Yeah, that sounds wonderful.

329
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.420
Joel Beier: We love like a lot of fun. Yeah, and

330
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:19.440
Joel Beier: At the end of the day it's a fun activity well lab, it's, it's crushing it cans of fun activities and then to lab see them better.

331
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:29.670
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, no, it makes it so that they're having fun like for a good week because they're crushing cans. I mean, they are taking data, but they're having a great time.

332
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.470
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, so good.

333
00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.530
Carole Namowicz: Wonderful. Yeah, it's a good time.

334
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:35.820
Good.

335
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.130
Joel Beier: Alright, I'm not so sure.

336
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.140
Joel Beier: What also, I get a message.

337
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.480
Carole Namowicz: From jumping to somewhere else. I mean,

338
00:39:45.480 --> 00:40:00.360
Joel Beier: Yeah but i well i guess i part of me wants to stick around, so that we can shed. But then the other part is I don't know if I'm supposed to be anywhere else, or if you'd like to just have a break and before your next

339
00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.020
Carole Namowicz: Oh, no.

340
00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:06.120
Carole Namowicz: Free, feel free to go ahead and jump around.

341
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.860
Carole Namowicz: And i mean i

342
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:12.840
Carole Namowicz: I think i think i'm only on here for another 20 minutes or so. Anyway, so it's all good.

343
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.020
Carole Namowicz: I'm okay to another group. If you want to come back that's cool too.

344
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:24.240
Joel Beier: Yeah. Wonderful, thank you so much for sharing everything was great to talk to you and I enjoyed reminiscing

345
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:27.450
Joel Beier: Some nighttime.

346
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.530
Carole Namowicz: Yeah.

347
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:33.930
Joel Beier: And then Jamie that I've. This is the first we've met. So it was great to meet you and

348
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.160
Jamie Lee - Staff: Nice meeting you.

349
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.530
Joel Beier: Thank you for helping facilitate

350
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.650
Jamie Lee - Staff: No problem. And yeah, if you're interested in any of the tools we use. They're all available online net logo and

351
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:54.450
Joel Beier: tango code out is Shelly and shown. We were, we played with them briefly I think last fall back when we meet in person, but

352
00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:00.000
Joel Beier: I have not dug into it quite yet. So I might play with that later.

353
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.810
Yeah.

354
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.510
Joel Beier: Yeah, thank you. Enjoy.

355
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.710
Carole Namowicz: Thank you.

356
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.870
Carole Namowicz: So do I just hang out and see if more people come

357
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.400
Jamie Lee - Staff: Exactly, yeah.

358
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.620
Carole Namowicz: And I don't know what happened to Katie, um,

359
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.130
Jamie Lee - Staff: Yeah, I've been trying to reach her on Slack, but she's not on air right now.

360
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:31.170
Carole Namowicz: No, I don't know what's up because I G chatter and and nothing. So I don't know if she just didn't know that we were supposed to be in this channel or what the heck happened because obviously we just made that video this morning.

361
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:38.970
Carole Namowicz: Oh, we were talking plenty this morning. Um, so I'm not sure what happened there.

362
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.190
Carole Namowicz: I'm actually wondering if she was bouncing around looking at other people's I have no idea.

363
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:51.960
Jamie Lee - Staff: No.

364
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:56.430
Jamie Lee - Staff: Possibility. Yeah. Yes. Sally, but I don't think she's seen her either

365
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.480
Carole Namowicz: Okay, okay.

366
00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:11.670
Jamie Lee - Staff: I'll just post in the chat and let people know the cameras open

367
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.990
Carole Namowicz: Sounds good.

368
00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.030
Okay.

369
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.790
Carole Namowicz: We'll see if she helps in

370
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:58.050
Yeah.

371
00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.440
Jamie Lee - Staff: It's getting pretty close to the

372
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:02.760
Carole Namowicz: Nine. I know.

373
00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:10.380
Jamie Lee - Staff: I think will be in like a main room. Oh 1125

374
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:11.130
Okay.

375
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.640
Jamie Lee - Staff: Jordan brick is going to join us. She's one of our A's.

376
00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:25.500
Jordan Brick: Hello.

377
00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.650
Jordan Brick: My room is also empty. So, okay.

378
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:33.480
Carole Namowicz: Gotcha.

379
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.470
Jordan Brick: Other people's

380
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:35.580
Jamie Lee - Staff: Stuff. Yeah.

381
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.000
Carole Namowicz: You want to see anything or

382
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.800
Jordan Brick: Less. I would love to see here

383
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.170
Carole Namowicz: Oh, here I'll show you.

384
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.420
Jordan Brick: Let's see here.

385
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.210
I have it up here.

386
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.200
Carole Namowicz: I'm going to

387
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.690
Carole Namowicz: Hold on, I have to, I have to get the cool new one up for you guys.

388
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.900
Carole Namowicz: Which is here.

389
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:20.520
Carole Namowicz: So I just popped it here. So this is a simulation that women and Jamie are working on. So this is chemistry and this unit is based around the idea. I don't know if you've ever seen the can crush before you know I'm talking about

390
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.830
Carole Namowicz: Yes, no, maybe so.

391
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.430
Jordan Brick: Not sure.

392
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.020
Carole Namowicz: Hold on, I'm

393
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:26.880
Carole Namowicz: Here we go.

394
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.450
Carole Namowicz: Start. But that was the container halfway full advice and then add water all the way for

395
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.640
Carole Namowicz: About a tablespoon of the water to an aluminum cans and then please to scan.

396
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.380
Carole Namowicz: During the hot plate on high wait for students to be pointing out at

397
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:54.930
Carole Namowicz: This point your canvas ready to be uploaded. Remove the cam from the hot plate using top and then in one motion for the rest of the fluid and some worse the top of the candidate has water.

398
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:08.130
Carole Namowicz: Alright, so anyway, um, we have kids do this every year we do this demo first and they do as a major lab and this year is going to be so interesting.

399
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.350
Carole Namowicz: Where obviously they're not going to be able to physically do all these things in our lab this year at all.

400
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:21.330
Carole Namowicz: But it's really great learning tool for looking at pressure volume temperature number of particles, all of those things that contribute to

401
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:33.210
Carole Namowicz: Gas behavior. So what Jamie had been working on is, where is it is this cute little simulation where

402
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:48.120
Carole Namowicz: You can see here you. It starts with see inside clicked on. But you can click it off. So here's your can right and you can put it on the hot plate and let it get hot, and then take it over here.

403
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:56.850
Carole Namowicz: And it's supposed to crush. There we go. Crush can right. Yay. Um, but like that ended of itself. Great. You should have just, you know, looked at a video and

404
00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:03.630
Carole Namowicz: We will of course be recording the actual can crushing ourselves, we just pulled a quick one off of YouTube, but we'll be doing it for the students.

405
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:22.260
Carole Namowicz: But if you go to see inside, then you can start with the actual view of what's going on inside the can, what's actually causing it to crush on, so that students will still be able to do this lab, there'll be able to collect data.

406
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.480
Carole Namowicz: So there'll be able to collect data on the deer. There'll be collecting is the percent crush.

407
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:37.530
Carole Namowicz: Um, so we're trying to make it so that they can still do this major lab that they do every year even though we're going to be remote

408
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:48.660
Carole Namowicz: But the other really helpful thing for us this year I'm all, not just this year with another helpful thing is very often when students really do this lab. They don't understand why they can crushes anyway.

409
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:59.070
Carole Namowicz: So we're hoping that in future years. They'll do the real thing in class and they do tons of trials because we have them actually manipulate a variable.

410
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.420
Carole Namowicz: But they'll be able to look at the microscopic version of what's going on here and be able to see

411
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:19.500
Carole Namowicz: What the particles were doing that ultimately caused the can to implode so that's that's the ultimate goal here is for them to explain it in terms of particle motion. And so this is just

412
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:26.760
Carole Namowicz: version that went and Jamie made within like a few days ago. Um, so it's just a jumping off point. They have to add a lot of

413
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:37.410
Carole Namowicz: Slider bars is variables like how long, how long you leave it on the hot plate that's just, you know, however long you're holding it there. But how much water would you put in the can to begin with, um,

414
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.990
Carole Namowicz: And how big the can is there's going to be a slider bar for that students are going to be able to change the

415
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:55.800
Carole Namowicz: The ice bucket to different temperatures as well. And then there's going to be an output for the percent crush of the cans, they're going to be able to say, See winds of the can crush or not and how much

416
00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:01.260
Carole Namowicz: I don't think that the visual is going to look really anything different than this, except for a crushed can but

417
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:12.420
Carole Namowicz: It's still going to show if it crushes or not like will probably figure out some threshold Jamie for, like, when to show it crushed or not. I think that would be easy enough. But they'll get they'll get quantitative output. So

418
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:20.850
Carole Namowicz: Um, so when they're really doing this lab and you know hopefully in another year from now, then they'll be able to take this and compare

419
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:30.450
Carole Namowicz: What happened in the simulation to their actual data to see if my data good or not. And they'll also be able to see on a microscopic scale what the particles were doing that cause the can.

420
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.200
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): To implode

421
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.700
Carole Namowicz: Anybody else questions or stuff or

422
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:41.040
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): Yes. I mean, I just

423
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:41.790
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): I just joined

424
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:43.110
Hi.

425
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:50.460
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): This is Amit. I mean, so, so how are, how are you using the interactive stuff.

426
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.030
Carole Namowicz: Oh, you mean as far as the simulation goes

427
00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.170
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): Yes, it is.

428
00:49:55.380 --> 00:50:03.450
Carole Namowicz: Okay, so this our unit is based around the can crushing you're familiar with the can crush you know what yeah so

429
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:12.420
Carole Namowicz: Students usually do this as a big major lab and they're not doing it this year, at least not the real thing, not in class, not with materials.

430
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:20.280
Carole Namowicz: So Wilmot and Jamie have made us the simulation so that students can still work through this, they can still collect data.

431
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:28.620
Carole Namowicz: But obviously, here we have this little see inside aspect. So if you click it off. You don't see the particles that are in the canvas. As soon as you do.

432
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:37.770
Carole Namowicz: You can see the particles that are going to be in the can. Now, we still need to add a ton of slider bars for the number of particles that start off in the can.

433
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:55.950
Carole Namowicz: The size of the can. And there's also going to be a slider bar for the temperature of the the ice bucket over here, but students will take a can leave it on hot plate and then they bring it over. There we go. They bring it over here and

434
00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:58.590
Carole Namowicz: Crush.

435
00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:11.820
Carole Namowicz: Whoa what's supposed to happen is, and I think we'll probably work on the particle speed as well. More but ultimately they should obviously see the particles get considerably slower. In fact, like slow down almost completely when we put it in the ice bucket.

436
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:25.200
Carole Namowicz: So we want them to make that connection with what the particles are doing throughout and ultimately why the can crushes but they're also going to be able to collect all this quantitative data.

437
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.970
Carole Namowicz: As if they were doing the lab, even though they're not going to be able to do the lab.

438
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.240
Carole Namowicz: But beyond just this year.

439
00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:47.100
Carole Namowicz: Students, we always have them do this major lab beyond this year, they never really understand like not never but a lot of students don't understand what's happening throughout the lab and why the can crushes so

440
00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:54.420
Carole Namowicz: They'll spend all this time taking real data with real cans after this year is over, fingers crossed, and

441
00:51:55.110 --> 00:52:04.560
Carole Namowicz: They'll be able to mess with the simulation to help explain it because it's something they have to do in their lab report is go through and explain the entire process and why they can crushes

442
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:15.000
Carole Namowicz: And a lot of students just don't understand why the can crushes. So this will help them throughout the process to see why did the can crush.

443
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.860
Carole Namowicz: On so worth. We're seeing it as being useful well beyond this year.

444
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:25.350
Carole Namowicz: Um, so that will be able to use it in years to come to have students after they do this whole lab.

445
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:35.760
Carole Namowicz: There'll be able to sit and then we'll say, okay, now here's the simulation compare your data to the simulation. Do you think you got good data in class because the simulation will be like ideal data.

446
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:42.690
Carole Namowicz: And then they'll also say, and you can also use the simulation to help you explain what's occurring on a microscopic level.

447
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:51.750
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): This is, this is amazing. I love it. This is like you gotta, you have doing both macroscopic and microscope in the same

448
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:53.970
Carole Namowicz: Room with idea. I really love it.

449
00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:04.140
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): Are you are you thinking about changing the the dimensions of the box. When you, when it crashes well

450
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:09.120
Carole Namowicz: Actually what we talked about specifically because we think that that would probably be pretty complicated.

451
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:17.400
Carole Namowicz: Is we're calling this a zoom in of the can. We're going to highlight. We're going to highlight a little square on the can.

452
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:24.930
Carole Namowicz: So that they can see where on the can. This is supposed to be representing the whole time. That way if they change the size of the can.

453
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:37.080
Carole Namowicz: The box in the center won't change, but they'll be able to see, oh, this is like a smaller part of the cam that's being represented now because the can itself is bigger. So that's something we talked about just yesterday, adding in

454
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:52.290
Katie Lindeman: Oh, sorry. I was just gonna say, I think if they if they start thinking that the box is the can, then that's a misinterpretation of how big gas particles are and that goes into some misconceptions that we're trying to

455
00:53:52.770 --> 00:54:09.300
Carole Namowicz: Yeah, and it also the can itself to start off with is open and then it's closed, and I think trying to actually mimic the whole can frankly and Jamie could speak to this more than I could. But I imagine that that would be really complex

456
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:14.250
Carole Namowicz: In terms of having the volume like change shape and

457
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.500
Carole Namowicz: Size and all this stuff and like

458
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:24.840
Carole Namowicz: We're not going there. I just, I like this is our first unit of the year and we know that we're going to have to have it ready in like a month and a half and

459
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:28.020
Carole Namowicz: I think that that would be a really big asked

460
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:29.190
Carole Namowicz: To um

461
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:35.490
Carole Namowicz: So we, you know, I'm trying to keep our expectations realistic and all this. So,

462
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:43.230
Jamie Lee - Staff: It's already hard enough, trying to integrate. We basically reused and old particle simulation those already available in the library.

463
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:45.150
Jamie Lee - Staff: But

464
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.030
Jamie Lee - Staff: We should probably move on to the main room.

465
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:49.980
Carole Namowicz: All right.

466
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:50.700
sugat dabholkar (he/him/his): Thank you.

467
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.700
Jamie Lee - Staff: Thank you for joining us.

468
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.180
Carole Namowicz: Are we going back to the main room.

469
00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.140
Jamie Lee - Staff: Yes, yes.

470
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.700
Katie Lindeman: Yes, sorry about being late. I

471
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.260
Katie Lindeman: Here's a king rat situation in my backyard.

472
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:18.030
Carole Namowicz: Sorry, I think everyone just saw that that G chat. I'm sorry, I forgot I was sharing the

473
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.360
Screen.

474
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:20.280
Katie Lindeman: Just fine.

475
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.150
Katie Lindeman: It's okay, it's

476
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.160
Carole Namowicz: Everything all right.

477
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.740
Katie Lindeman: Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's gonna be okay.

478
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:29.760
Okay.

479
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:31.980
Katie Lindeman: Yeah, exactly.

480
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.020
Katie Lindeman: Okay, so we're going, we're going back to the normal

481
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:34.890
Carole Namowicz: Room. Okay.

482
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.120
Katie Lindeman: All right. All right. Bye. Oh.

483
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:36.840
Okay.
